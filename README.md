# PhiZone Player

PhiZone Player is an HTML5 Phigros chart player/simulator based on Phaser.

### Frameworks

This project is made possible by:

- [Phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)
- [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

## Introduction

Much of this program resembles any other Phigros chart player/simulator, so this section will focus solely on its unique features.

### User-friendly landing page

Designed with [Preline UI](https://preline.co/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), the landing page is meticulously written to be as intuitive yet powerful as possible.

Choose either some files (or .zip/.pez archives) or an entire folder, and chart bundles will be automatically detected according to Re: PhiEdit (or RPE) metadata files (typically named `info.txt`) in which a chart, a song, and an illustration are specified. Any other files that fail to be recognized, which are most likely multimedia that will be referenced by the chart, or the `extra.json` from Phira, will be presented in the assets.

Additionally, the program can automatically download files from URLs specified in the `zip` and `file` search parameters. A `zip` parameter should be provided a URL to a zip archive, while a `file` parameter should be provided a URL to a regular file.

### Innovative keyboard controls

Similar to a video player, the program includes handy keyboard controls on autoplay mode:

- Pause/Resume: Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to toggle.
- Rewind/Forward: Use <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> to jump 5 seconds, or <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd> for precise 0.1-second adjustments.

Besides, <kbd>ESC</kbd> is always available to pause with the pause screen.

### APNG support

Animated PNGs are an excellent alternative to GIFs, offering enhanced color fidelity and the support of an 8-bit alpha channel for smoother transparency effects.

An APNG acts exactly the same way as a GIF does, unless the number of repetitions is specified in the file, according to the APNG specification.

### Z indexes

The Z index (depth) defines the order in which game objects are rendered. The lower the value, the earlier they are rendered.

| Default Z index (depth) | Object(s)                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                       | Illustration                                                               |
| 1                       | Background video, if present                                               |
| [2, 3)                  | Judgment lines, the order of which are determined by their `zOrder` values |
| 3                       | Hold notes                                                                 |
| 4                       | Drag notes                                                                 |
| 5                       | Tap notes                                                                  |
| 6                       | Flick notes                                                                |
| 7                       | Hit effects                                                                |
| 8                       | Pause button                                                               |
| 9                       | Combo counter                                                              |
| 10                      | Text beneath the combo counter                                             |
| 11                      | Score                                                                      |
| 12                      | Std deviation & accuracy                                                   |
| 13                      | Progress bar                                                               |
| 14                      | Song title                                                                 |
| 15                      | Level name & difficulty                                                    |

The Z indexes of judgment lines whose `zIndex` is not present (see [Chart enhancements](#chart-enhancements)) are calculated based on their `zOrder` values ([code here](https://github.com/PhiZone/player/blob/ed8a6119a28c8594d372aacb8e1da12fdce6d692/src/player/utils.ts#L595)). Simply put, the values are mapped onto [0, 1) and made equally spaced, and then get added by 2 to become Z indexes. See examples below.

| `zOrder`           | Z index               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| 0, 10, 20, 30      | 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75    |
| 127, 0, 0, 1       | 2.6667, 2, 2, 2.3333  |
| 1, 2, 5, 6, 114514 | 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 |

### Chart enhancements

Aside from adding support for RPE features, we've also designed some original properties for judgment lines & notes.

| Property             | Value(s)                                            | Example                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scaleOnNotes`       | `0`: none; `1`: scale; `2`: clip                    | `"scaleOnNotes": 2`             | Belongs to a judgment line. Decides how `scaleX` events affect notes. Defaults to `0`.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `appearanceOnAttach` | `0`: hidden; `1`: white colored; `2`: FC/AP colored | `"appearanceOnAttach": 2`       | Belongs to a judgment line. Decides how the line will be displayed when a UI component or any video is attached to it. Color events will override the color defined by these options. Defaults to `0`.                                                                         |
| `zIndex`             | an integer or a float                               | `"zIndex": 3.5`                 | Belongs to a judgment line or note. Sets the Z index for the object. For a judgment line, this property, if set, overrides the `zOrder` property, allowing for more control over on which layer the line should be displayed. For default values, see [Z indexes](#z-indexes). |
| `zIndexHitEffects`   | an integer or a float                               | `"zIndexHitEffects": 6.5`       | Belongs to a note. Sets the Z index for the hit effects of the note. Defaults to `7`.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `tint`               | [R, G, B], as seen in `colorEvents`; `null`         | `"tint": [255, 0, 0]`           | Belongs to a note. Sets the tint for the note. Defaults to `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `tintHitEffects`     | [R, G, B], as seen in `colorEvents`; `null`         | `"tintHitEffects": [255, 0, 0]` | Belongs to a note. Sets the tint for the hit effects of the note. Defaults to `null`.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Video enhancements

Support for videos in `extra.json` gets extended with the following new properties for each entry in the `videos` list:

| Property | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zIndex` | Number | Determines the Z index for this video. Defaults to `1`.                                     |
| `attach` | Object | Attaches this video to a judgment line, if this property is present. See below for details. |

Properties residing in the `attach` object:

| Property                     | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `line`                       | Number | Determines which line this video is attached to.                                                                                                  |
| `positionXFactor` (optional) | Number | Multiplied by the x position of the line, determines the x position of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                               |
| `positionYFactor` (optional) | Number | Multiplied by the y position of the line, determines the y position of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                               |
| `rotationFactor` (optional)  | Number | Multiplied by the rotation of the line, determines the rotation of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                                   |
| `alphaFactor` (optional)     | Number | Multiplied by the alpha of the line, determines the alpha of this video, together with the `alpha` property of the video itself. Defaults to `1`. |
| `tintFactor` (optional)      | Number | Multiplied by the tint of the line, determines the tint of this video. Defaults to `1`.                                                           |
| `scaleXMode` (optional)      | Number | Determines how `scaleX` events of the line affect this video. Values same as in `scaleOnNotes`. Defaults to `0`.                                  |
| `scaleYMode` (optional)      | Number | Determines how `scaleY` events of the line affect this video. Values same as in `scaleOnNotes`. Defaults to `0`.                                  |

### Shader enhancements

Except for WebGL's incompatibilities with newer versions of GLSL, the program supports not only all the shader features defined by `extra.json`, but also one original addition to the standard: **target range**.

A target range defines a list of depth-adjacent (next to each other on the Z axis) game objects that a shader event is applied to. It belongs directly to a shader event (as the optional `targetRange` property) and consists of the following properties:

| Property               | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minZIndex`            | Number  | Defines the minimum Z index (depth) of this range. Inclusive.                                                                                                                           |
| `maxZIndex`            | Number  | Defines the maximum Z index (depth) of this range. Exclusive.                                                                                                                           |
| `exclusive` (optional) | Boolean | Determines whether this range should exclude the range of another active shader event when the two ranges intersect but this range is not a superset of the other. Defaults to `false`. |

If the `global` property of a shader event is set to `true`, then its `targetRange` will not function.

One thing to note is that a single object cannot be rendered in parallel by two or more shaders. However, a set of targets from one shader event can be safely contained within the targets of another shader event. This leads to the concept of the `exclusive` property - it determines whether or not to "swallow" another set of objects when it intersects with but is not a subset of the current.

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "effects": [
    {
      "start": [293, 0, 1],
      "end": [300, 0, 1],
      "shader": "/example.glsl",
      "global": false,
      "targetRange": {
        "minZIndex": 3,
        "maxZIndex": 4,
      }, // Hold notes
      "vars": {
        // ...
      },
    },
    {
      "start": [293, 0, 1],
      "end": [463, 0, 1],
      "shader": "/example.glsl",
      "global": false,
      "targetRange": {
        "minZIndex": 8,
        "maxZIndex": 16,
      }, // The entire UI
      "vars": {
        // ...
      },
    },
    {
      "start": [66, 0, 1],
      "end": [296, 0, 1],
      "shader": "/another-example.glsl",
      "global": true,
      // targetRange is optional
      "vars": {
        // ...
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Notice that there are two events that share the same shader code. This is a workaround when you want to apply the same shader to objects that are not adjacent on the Z axis.

<sup>1</sup> Support for fragment shaders is partial, due to WebGL relying on an older version of GLSL.

A version is reached whenever at least one feature from this version is marked as `🚧 Working`, and all features from the previous versions are marked as `✅ Done`. A version is released only when all features from this version and the previous versions are marked as `✅ Done`.
